- controller DSL

- error classes and messages
- i18n error messages

- account for namespaces when setting classes (or test if it just works as is?)
- maybe rework some of the method and association names to use the provided values instead of the keys (like :user instead of :subject). alternately maybe figure out a way to namespace acts_as_*? would allow something to behave with many acts_as_* without a conflict (i.e. possess Roles and SpecialRoles)
- make sure context excludes permission methods when not used
- allow restricting contexts (so subject can only be assigned permissions within that context)

- include a default Role and Permission model + generator for migration?
- generators for Role, Permission, RolePermission, SubjectRole, SubjectPermission models?
- generators for migrations to add fields to custom Role, Permission models?

- helpers for views like --  <% requires_role(:role) do %>HTML HERE<% end %>
