Controller DSL
  - add built-in default options for catching access denied and redirecting or rendering w/ flash or error template
  - use configuration objects in the DSL stuff instead of the current options hash
  - specs - test dsl in isolation with dummy controller object, test controller implementations
  - clean up logging (create logger class that prefixes with ACL, keeps track of time, etc.)



ActiveRecord Authorization
  - abstract the activerecord stuff a little further and create an ORM layer
  - specs for generators



General
  - error/exception classes and messages
  - i18n error messages
  - add :debug config, create logger class, log activerecord stuff as well







NOTES
  + actions, roles and permissions are tacked on to any default/parent :actions, :roles or :permissions
  + moved role/permission checks into #allow?, #deny? and #match? - allows decoupling ACL DSL from ActiveRecord Authorization by overriding those methods in the DSL block or in a monkeypatch
